# ajaxamp-api

AjaxAMP is a third-party plugin for the Winamp media player. It provides an HTTP Ajax style interface to control Winamp.
This document describes the web interface using OpenAPI 3.0.

This project was made using [Stoplight.io](https://stoplight.io/). Stoplight can open and display the interface in it's
web based IDE simply by providing the github URL for this project.

Also agailable on [Swagger Hub](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/mveroukis/AjaxAmp/1.0.0).

Note that this is the first and the last version of this protocol as development has ended. The plan is to replace AjaxAMP
with something else.
